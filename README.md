## Usage

For usage of this application users can write code or just general text into the editor, save their information when navigating away from the page and/or when returning  to the page. 

## Installation

To start the server a user must first install the required dependancies for both the server and client folders, so using `npm install` will prompt `cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i`. Then a user must build the server with `npm run build` and finally `npm start dev` or `npm start`.

## Screenshots
